# Fraunhofer_Diffraction_pattern

Producing the light diffraction pattern produced by different shaped apertures. The Gaussian aperture is used as a building block to eventually producing the diffracted field caused by a collision of LASER pulses with Gaussian transverse profiles. The phenomena of photon-photon scattering is possible due to energy fluctuations in the quantum vacuum and sufficiently intense LASER's. 

It also demonstrates use of a couple of different integration routines from the gsl library, implemented in C++. Plots produced in Mathematica and Python.
